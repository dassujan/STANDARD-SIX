# PHYSICS: MATTER [UNIT]

### 1. What Is Matter?

**Definition:**  
- **Matter** is anything that has mass (weight) and takes up space (volume).  
- Everything you see around you—a chair, a book, water, air, and even the toys you play with—are made of matter.

**Key Points:**  
- **Mass:** Shows how much "stuff" is in an object.  
- **Volume:** Tells you how much space the object occupies.

**In Simple Terms:**  
Matter is like the "stuff" that makes up everything. If you can see it or feel it, and it fills up some space, it is matter.

### 2. Activities to Demonstrate the Properties of Matter

### Activity 2.1: Weight of Solids and Liquids

- **Objective:**  
  To show that both solids and liquids have weight (mass).

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - An empty plastic beaker is tied and suspended on a spring balance to record its weight.
  - When water is poured into the beaker, the reading on the spring balance increases.
  - Repeating the experiment with sand and pebbles further shows that these substances also register a weight—often more than water.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  Solids (sand, pebbles) and liquids (water) both possess weight and, therefore, mass.

### Activity 2.2: Demonstrating That Air Has Mass

- **Objective:**  
  To reveal that even air, though not visible, has mass.

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - Two equally inflated balloons are balanced on opposite sides of a half-meter scale.
  - Heating the tip of an iron needle and then touching one of the balloons causes it to burst. Air escapes from the burst balloon.
  - The scale tilts towards the side with the intact balloon, indicating a reduction in weight on the side of the burst balloon.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  The difference in weight demonstrates that the air in the balloon has mass. When some air is lost, the mass decreases, changing the balance.

### Activity 2.3: Showing that Solids and Liquids Occupy Space

- **Objective:**  
  To illustrate that any substance—whether solid or liquid—occupies space.

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - A glass tumbler is placed inside a bowl and filled with water.
  - When a small stone, tied with a thread, is lowered into the water in the tumbler, some water overflows, showing that the stone occupies space.
  - Removing the stone causes the water level to drop, and pouring the overflow water back confirms that the original volume of the tumbler remains constant.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  Both the stone (a solid) and water (a liquid) show that matter occupies space.

### Activity 2.4: Proving Gases Occupy Space

- **Objective:**  
  To demonstrate that gases (specifically air) also occupy space.

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - An empty glass tumbler is inverted into a trough of water. Despite being completely submerged, the water level inside the tumbler is lower than the water outside.
  - This difference is due to the air trapped inside the tumbler, which prevents water from filling the entire volume.
  - Tilting the tumbler causes air bubbles to escape, and water then flows in to replace them.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  The trapped air shows that gases occupy space.

### 3. Composition of Matter

Everything in our world is made of tiny particles:
- **Atoms:**  
  - The smallest unit of matter.
  - Atoms cannot be split by normal physical or chemical means.
- **Molecules:**  
  - Groups of atoms bonded together.
  - A molecule can have one, two, or many atoms. For example, water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

**In Simple Terms:**  
Imagine atoms as small building blocks. Molecules are made when two or more of these building blocks come together. All objects, whether they are solids, liquids, or gases, are made up of these tiny particles.

### 4. States of Matter

Matter can exist in three common states: **solids, liquids, and gases**. Each state has different properties.

### Solids
- **Properties:**
  - **Definite Shape and Volume:** Solids do not change shape. A chair or table always stays the same shape.
  - **Incompressible:** The particles are packed tightly together, so you cannot easily compress them.
  - **Fixed Arrangement:** The particles only vibrate in place and do not slide around.
- **Everyday Example:**  
  A block of wood or a toy car always keeps its shape.

### Liquids
- **Properties:**
  - **Definite Volume but No Fixed Shape:** Liquids always occupy the same amount of space, but they take the shape of their container.  
  - **Flow Easily:** The particles move past each other, which makes liquids flow.
  - **Incompressible:** Liquids cannot be compressed easily.
  - **Free Surface:** When a liquid is in a container, it always has a flat top surface.
- **Everyday Example:**  
  Water in a glass takes the shape of the glass, but it always remains the same amount of water.

### Gases
- **Properties:**
  - **No Definite Shape or Volume:** Gases fill the container they are in, whether it is a balloon or a room.
  - **Highly Compressible:** There is a lot of empty space between the particles, so gases can be compressed easily.
  - **Rapid and Random Motion:** The particles move very fast in every direction.
- **Everyday Example:**  
  The air we breathe fills up the entire room, no matter the shape of the room.

### 5. Why Do Matter’s States Behave Differently?

The differences come from two factors:

1. **Intermolecular Forces:**  
   These are the forces that hold the particles (atoms or molecules) together.
   - **Solids:** Have very strong forces; particles are stuck together in a fixed pattern.
   - **Liquids:** Have intermediate forces; particles are close but can move around each other.
   - **Gases:** Have very weak forces; particles move freely with lots of space in between.

2. **Intermolecular Space:**  
   This is the space between the particles.
   - **Solids:** Particles are very close with almost no empty space.
   - **Liquids:** There is a little space between particles.
   - **Gases:** Particles are far apart, which is why gases expand to fill any container.

**Q41. What happens to the weight reading on a spring balance when a beaker is filled with water compared to when it is empty? [2 marks]**  
The weight reading on the spring balance increases when the beaker is filled with water because water has mass, unlike an empty beaker.

**Q42. Describe the experiment that shows that air has mass. [3 marks]**  
In the experiment, two equally inflated balloons are balanced on a scale; when one balloon is punctured and loses air, the scale tilts, showing that the air remaining gives weight.

**Q43. How does the experiment using a glass tumbler and a stone prove that solids occupy space? [2 marks]**  
The experiment proves that solids occupy space because when a stone is submerged in water, it displaces water, causing some water to overflow.

**Q44. What observation confirms that liquids have a definite volume? [2 marks]**  
The observation that when a liquid is poured from one container to another, its amount remains the same confirms that liquids have a definite volume.

**Q45. Why can gases be compressed much more than liquids? [3 marks]**  
Gases can be compressed much more than liquids because the molecules in a gas are spread far apart, leaving plenty of empty space that can be reduced under pressure.

**Q46. What experiment demonstrates that liquids are not compressible? [2 marks]**  
Using a sealed syringe filled with water, it is observed that when pressure is applied by pushing the plunger, the volume of water does not change, which shows that liquids are not compressible.

**Q47. What does the term “surface tension” refer to in liquids? [2 marks]**  
Surface tension refers to the force of attraction among the molecules at the surface of a liquid, causing them to stick together and form a smooth surface.

**Q48. How does the experiment with the glass tumbler and water demonstrate that air occupies space? [3 marks]**  
The experiment demonstrates that air occupies space because when a glass tumbler is lowered vertically into a trough of water, the water level inside the tumbler is lower than the water level outside due to the trapped air.

**Q49. What is observed when bubbles of air are released from a tilted tumbler? [1 mark]**  
When bubbles of air are released from a tilted tumbler, it is observed that water flows in to take the place of the exiting air.

**Q50. Summarize the conclusion reached from the experiments on solids, liquids, and gases. [3 marks]**  
The experiments conclude that all materials—whether solid, liquid, or gas—have mass and occupy space, which confirms that matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.

### **Section 5: Characteristics of Solids, Liquids, and Gases (Comparative Properties)**

**Q51. List two defining properties of solids. [2 marks]**  
Solids have a definite shape and a definite volume.

**Q52. What does it mean when we say liquids do not have a definite shape? [2 marks]**  
It means that liquids take the shape of the container they are placed in instead of keeping their own fixed shape.

**Q53. How do gases differ in shape compared to solids and liquids? [2 marks]**  
Gases differ because they do not have any definite shape and expand to fill the entire container they are in.

**Q54. Compare the compressibility of solids, liquids, and gases. [3 marks]**  
Solids cannot be compressed at all, liquids are only slightly compressible, and gases are highly compressible due to the large spaces between their molecules.

**Q55. Why do liquids have a free and flat surface when at rest? [2 marks]**  
Liquids have a free and flat surface because the molecules at the top are not constrained by the container’s sides, so they naturally form a level surface.

**Q56. What property of gases allows perfume to be smelled throughout a room? [3 marks]**  
The property is that gases, because their molecules move freely and mix easily, can spread a scent like perfume throughout an entire room.

**Q57. How do the intermolecular distances in solids compare to those in gases? [2 marks]**  
In solids, the intermolecular distances are very small, while in gases, the distances between molecules are very large.

**Q58. What happens to the molecules in a solid when heat is applied? [3 marks]**  
When heat is applied to a solid, its molecules vibrate more vigorously, but they remain in their fixed positions, causing very little expansion.

**Q59. Explain how the property of surface tension in liquids is demonstrated in everyday life. [3 marks]**  
Surface tension is demonstrated in everyday life when water forms droplets and when bugs are able to walk on the surface of water because the molecules stick together at the surface.

**Q60. How does the table of properties help us differentiate between the three states of matter? [4 marks]**  
The table helps differentiate the states of matter by comparing properties such as intermolecular forces, shape, volume, compressibility, and molecular motion; showing that solids are rigid, liquids flow and have a constant volume, and gases expand to fill the container.

### **Section 6: Intermolecular Forces and Molecular Arrangement**

**Q61. What are intermolecular forces of attraction? [2 marks]**  
Intermolecular forces of attraction are the forces that hold molecules together by attracting them to one another.

**Q62. Differentiate between cohesion and adhesion. [3 marks]**  
Cohesion is the force of attraction between similar molecules, while adhesion is the force of attraction between different or dissimilar molecules.

**Q63. How does the intermolecular space affect the state of matter? [3 marks]**  
The intermolecular space is the gap between molecules, and when this space is small, matter tends to be a solid; when it is larger, matter can be a liquid or gas.

**Q64. Why do solids expand negligibly on heating? [2 marks]**  
Solids expand negligibly on heating because their molecules are tightly packed together by strong intermolecular forces, leaving little space for expansion.

**Q65. In which state of matter are the intermolecular forces negligibly small? [1 mark]**  
Intermolecular forces are negligibly small in gases.

**Q66. How are molecules arranged in a liquid compared to a solid? [3 marks]**  
In a liquid, molecules are arranged with more space between them and can slide past each other, while in a solid, they are arranged in a fixed, closely packed structure.

**Q67. Explain why gases are easily compressible. [2 marks]**  
Gases are easily compressible because there is a large amount of empty space between the molecules, which can be reduced when pressure is applied.

**Q68. Describe the motion of molecules in a gas. [2 marks]**  
Molecules in a gas move randomly and rapidly in all directions, which is why a gas fills the entire volume of its container.

**Q69. What is the effect of intermolecular forces on the state of matter? [3 marks]**  
Stronger intermolecular forces in a substance help maintain a rigid structure as seen in solids, while weaker forces allow liquids to flow and gases to expand to fill their container.

**Q70. Summarize the importance of intermolecular forces in determining the properties of matter. [4 marks]**  
Intermolecular forces are important because they determine how closely molecules are held together, which in turn influences the state of matter, its compressibility, shape, volume, and how it responds to changes in temperature.

**Q71: Define cohesion and adhesion. [4 marks]**
- Cohesion: This is the force of attraction between similar molecules. For example, the water molecules stick together due to cohesion.
- Adhesion: This is the force of attraction between dissimilar molecules. For instance, water molecules can stick to the surface of a glass due to adhesion.
