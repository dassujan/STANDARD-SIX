# PHYSICS: MATTER [UNIT]

### 1. What Is Matter?

**Definition:**  
- **Matter** is anything that has mass (weight) and takes up space (volume).  
- Everything you see around you—a chair, a book, water, air, and even the toys you play with—are made of matter.

**Key Points:**  
- **Mass:** Shows how much "stuff" is in an object.  
- **Volume:** Tells you how much space the object occupies.

**In Simple Terms:**  
Matter is like the "stuff" that makes up everything. If you can see it or feel it, and it fills up some space, it is matter.

### 2. Activities to Demonstrate the Properties of Matter

### Activity 2.1: Weight of Solids and Liquids

- **Objective:**  
  To show that both solids and liquids have weight (mass).

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - An empty plastic beaker is tied and suspended on a spring balance to record its weight.
  - When water is poured into the beaker, the reading on the spring balance increases.
  - Repeating the experiment with sand and pebbles further shows that these substances also register a weight—often more than water.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  Solids (sand, pebbles) and liquids (water) both possess weight and, therefore, mass.

### Activity 2.2: Demonstrating That Air Has Mass

- **Objective:**  
  To reveal that even air, though not visible, has mass.

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - Two equally inflated balloons are balanced on opposite sides of a half-meter scale.
  - Heating the tip of an iron needle and then touching one of the balloons causes it to burst. Air escapes from the burst balloon.
  - The scale tilts towards the side with the intact balloon, indicating a reduction in weight on the side of the burst balloon.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  The difference in weight demonstrates that the air in the balloon has mass. When some air is lost, the mass decreases, changing the balance.

### Activity 2.3: Showing that Solids and Liquids Occupy Space

- **Objective:**  
  To illustrate that any substance—whether solid or liquid—occupies space.

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - A glass tumbler is placed inside a bowl and filled with water.
  - When a small stone, tied with a thread, is lowered into the water in the tumbler, some water overflows, showing that the stone occupies space.
  - Removing the stone causes the water level to drop, and pouring the overflow water back confirms that the original volume of the tumbler remains constant.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  Both the stone (a solid) and water (a liquid) show that matter occupies space.

### Activity 2.4: Proving Gases Occupy Space

- **Objective:**  
  To demonstrate that gases (specifically air) also occupy space.

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - An empty glass tumbler is inverted into a trough of water. Despite being completely submerged, the water level inside the tumbler is lower than the water outside.
  - This difference is due to the air trapped inside the tumbler, which prevents water from filling the entire volume.
  - Tilting the tumbler causes air bubbles to escape, and water then flows in to replace them.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  The trapped air shows that gases occupy space.

### 3. Composition of Matter

Everything in our world is made of tiny particles:
- **Atoms:**  
  - The smallest unit of matter.
  - Atoms cannot be split by normal physical or chemical means.
- **Molecules:**  
  - Groups of atoms bonded together.
  - A molecule can have one, two, or many atoms. For example, water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

**In Simple Terms:**  
Imagine atoms as small building blocks. Molecules are made when two or more of these building blocks come together. All objects, whether they are solids, liquids, or gases, are made up of these tiny particles.

### 4. States of Matter

Matter can exist in three common states: **solids, liquids, and gases**. Each state has different properties.

### Solids
- **Properties:**
  - **Definite Shape and Volume:** Solids do not change shape. A chair or table always stays the same shape.
  - **Incompressible:** The particles are packed tightly together, so you cannot easily compress them.
  - **Fixed Arrangement:** The particles only vibrate in place and do not slide around.
- **Everyday Example:**  
  A block of wood or a toy car always keeps its shape.

### Liquids
- **Properties:**
  - **Definite Volume but No Fixed Shape:** Liquids always occupy the same amount of space, but they take the shape of their container.  
  - **Flow Easily:** The particles move past each other, which makes liquids flow.
  - **Incompressible:** Liquids cannot be compressed easily.
  - **Free Surface:** When a liquid is in a container, it always has a flat top surface.
- **Everyday Example:**  
  Water in a glass takes the shape of the glass, but it always remains the same amount of water.

### Gases
- **Properties:**
  - **No Definite Shape or Volume:** Gases fill the container they are in, whether it is a balloon or a room.
  - **Highly Compressible:** There is a lot of empty space between the particles, so gases can be compressed easily.
  - **Rapid and Random Motion:** The particles move very fast in every direction.
- **Everyday Example:**  
  The air we breathe fills up the entire room, no matter the shape of the room.

### 5. Why Do Matter’s States Behave Differently?

The differences come from two factors:

1. **Intermolecular Forces:**  
   These are the forces that hold the particles (atoms or molecules) together.
   - **Solids:** Have very strong forces; particles are stuck together in a fixed pattern.
   - **Liquids:** Have intermediate forces; particles are close but can move around each other.
   - **Gases:** Have very weak forces; particles move freely with lots of space in between.

2. **Intermolecular Space:**  
   This is the space between the particles.
   - **Solids:** Particles are very close with almost no empty space.
   - **Liquids:** There is a little space between particles.
   - **Gases:** Particles are far apart, which is why gases expand to fill any container.

### 6. Quick Comparison of Solids, Liquids, and Gases

   **Answer:** We can detect matter by measuring its weight and volume. Even if the matter is not visible, like air, its mass can be confirmed through experiments.

7. **What does it mean when we say matter “occupies space”? (Marks: 1)**  
   **Answer:** It means that matter takes up volume and cannot exist without having physical dimensions.

8. **Why is it important that matter has both mass and volume? (Marks: 3)**  
   **Answer:** It is important because the presence of mass lets us weigh matter and measure its inertia, while volume shows the space that the matter fills. This helps us identify, compare, and use different materials in practical applications.

9. **Using the description provided, summarize the properties that identify any substance as matter. (Marks: 4)**  
   **Answer:** Any substance is identified as matter if it possesses two essential properties: it must have mass and it must occupy space. This means that all objects, whether visible or not, have a measurable weight and volume.

10. **Describe the significance of the term “material body” based on the text. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** A material body is an object made of matter, meaning it can be weighed and takes up space. This term underlines that all physical objects qualify as matter because they have these inherent properties.

11. **Why do we use objects like chairs, carts, and cycles as examples when discussing matter? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** We use objects such as chairs, carts, and cycles because they are common, everyday items that clearly show the properties of matter. Each of these objects has mass and volume, making the concept of matter easy to understand.

12. **What conclusion about matter can be drawn from the statement “All material bodies have weight and hence have mass”? (Marks: 1)**

    **Answer:** Volume refers to the amount of space occupied by matter.

16. **Summarize why matter exists in the universe according to the introduction. (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** Matter exists in the universe because it is made up of particles that have both mass and volume. Every object, whether small like a pebble or large like a bullock cart, is composed of matter. This universality of matter allows us to see, measure, and interact with everything around us.

17. **How does the concept of matter help us to understand the physical world? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** The concept of matter explains that all physical objects are composed of material substances with mass and volume. Understanding matter allows us to study properties like weight, density, and volume which are crucial in science and everyday life.

18. **Illustrate with an example how everyday items demonstrate the property that matter has mass. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** For instance, when you weigh a book on a scale, the scale shows a numerical value because the book has mass. This simple action demonstrates that matter possesses weight.

19. **What is meant by the term “material bodies” in the context of the lesson? (Marks: 2)**

    **Answer:** Air is considered matter because it occupies space and has mass even though it is not easily visible.

### **Section 2: Experiments Demonstrating the Properties of Matter**

21. **Explain the purpose of using a spring balance in Activity 1. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The spring balance is used to measure the weight of the objects, demonstrating that both solids and liquids have mass.

22. **What observation is made when water is poured into an empty beaker suspended by a spring balance? (Marks: 1)**  
    **Answer:** The observation is that the spring balance shows more weight when water is poured into the beaker.

23. **Detail the conclusion reached from comparing the weight of water with that of sand and pebbles in the experiment. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** The conclusion reached is that while both liquids and solids have weight, solids such as sand and pebbles may register a higher weight compared to water because of their greater mass.

24. **In Activity 2, why do two balloons need to be inflated equally before the experiment? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The balloons are inflated equally to ensure that both have the same amount of air, allowing a fair comparison when one is later punctured.

25. **Describe the result when a heated needle is used to puncture one balloon in Activity 2. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** When the heated needle punctures one balloon, that balloon bursts and loses air, causing the scale to tilt towards the side with the intact balloon.

26. **What does the tilting of the scale in Activity 2 indicate about the air inside the balloons? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The tilting of the scale indicates that the air inside the balloons has weight and contributes to the overall mass of the balloon.

27. **Summarize the main conclusion drawn from Activity 2. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The main conclusion is that air, although invisible, has weight and mass because its presence affects the balance of the scale.

28. **In Activity 3, why does water overflow from the tumbler when a stone is lowered into it? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** Water overflows from the tumbler because the stone occupies space, displacing some of the water.

29. **How does Activity 3 demonstrate that both solids and liquids occupy space? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Activity 3 demonstrates that solids and liquids occupy space by showing that when a stone (solid) is immersed in water (liquid), it pushes the water out, indicating that both have their own volume.

30. **What is the significance of pouring the overflow water back into the tumbler in Activity 3? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** Pouring the overflow water back into the tumbler signifies that the water fills the exact space it originally occupied, affirming that liquids have a definite volume.

31. **Describe the experimental setup used in Activity 4 to show that gases occupy space. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** In Activity 4, an empty glass tumbler is lowered vertically into a trough of water, and the observation is made that the water level inside the tumbler is lower than the water outside due to trapped air occupying space within the tumbler.

32. **What observation in Activity 4 supports the claim that air has a fixed volume? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The observation that the water level inside the tumbler does not match the water level outside supports the claim that the air trapped within has its own volume.

33. **How do the experiments with the spring balance help students understand the concepts of mass and weight? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** The experiments with the spring balance help students understand that mass is a measure of the material in an object, and weight is the force due to gravity acting on that mass, as shown by the increasing readings on the balance when more matter is added.

34. **Why is it important to perform experiments like those described in the text when learning about matter? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** It is important to perform these experiments because hands-on experience helps to clearly visualize and verify the properties of matter such as mass, volume, and the fact that different substances can be measured. These experiments make abstract concepts more concrete and understandable.

35. **What does Activity 9 reveal about the compressibility of gases? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** Activity 9 reveals that gases can be compressed because when the plunger is pushed into a syringe containing air, the air inside is forced into a smaller volume.

36. **Contrast the behavior of a liquid and a gas when compressive forces are applied, based on the experiments. (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** When compressive forces are applied to a liquid, its volume does not change significantly due to its incompressible nature. In contrast, gases can be compressed easily as there is a significant amount of empty space between their particles, allowing their volume to reduce under pressure.

37. **How does the experiment using a glass tumbler in water demonstrate the space-occupying property of gases? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** The experiment with the glass tumbler shows that even when submerged, the trapped air inside prevents water from completely filling the tumbler. This demonstrates that gases also occupy space.

38. **What is the outcome when two identical balloons, filled equally with air, are used on a scale and one is punctured? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** When one of the identical balloons is punctured, the scale tilts towards the side with the intact balloon due to the loss of mass from the punctured balloon.

39. **Explain how the experiments listed help to prove that every type of matter, including air, has mass. (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** The experiments prove that every type of matter has mass by showing measurable differences in weight when additional substances like water, sand, or air are introduced or removed. For example, the spring balance readings change with different substances, and the balance scale tips when air is let out of a balloon, confirming that even invisible substances like air contribute mass.

40. **Using simple words, describe the importance of using experiments in understanding scientific concepts such as mass and volume. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Experiments are important because they allow us to see and measure scientific concepts like mass and volume in real life. This practical approach makes it easier to understand how different materials behave and interact with each other.

### **Section 3: Composition of Matter – Atoms, Molecules, and Elements**

41. **What is an atom? (Marks: 1)**  
    **Answer:** An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element.

42. **Explain the term “molecule” in simple words. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** A molecule is a group of atoms bonded together, which is the smallest particle of a substance that still has the properties of that substance.

43. **State the difference between atoms and molecules. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, while molecules are made up of two or more atoms bonded together. Thus, atoms combine to form molecules that have the same properties as the substance they represent.

44. **How are elements defined according to the chapter? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** Elements are substances that are made up of only one type of atom, such as hydrogen or oxygen.

45. **Describe what is meant by the composition of matter. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** The composition of matter refers to the fact that all physical substances are made up of extremely small particles called atoms and molecules. These particles combine in different ways to form the elements and compounds we see around us.

46. **Why can an atom not be split apart by normal chemical or physical processes? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** An atom cannot be split apart by normal chemical or physical processes because it is the smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an element.

47. **What are the two types of substances mentioned in the text, based on their atomic composition? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The two types of substances are elements, which consist of one type of atom, and compounds, which contain more than one type of atom.

48. **Illustrate with an example what a molecule can be composed of. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** A molecule can be composed of two oxygen atoms bonded together to form an oxygen gas molecule, or it can be made up of different atoms, such as hydrogen and oxygen forming a water molecule.

49. **What does the text mean by “mono-atomic,” “di-atomic,” and “poly-atomic” molecules? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** “Mono-atomic” molecules consist of a single atom, “di-atomic” molecules consist of two atoms bonded together, and “poly-atomic” molecules are made up of more than two atoms.

50. **Why is it important to know that a molecule is the smallest particle that can exist independently? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** It is important because understanding that a molecule is the smallest stable unit of a substance helps us comprehend chemical reactions and the properties of materials. Molecules retain the properties of the substance even when separated from the bulk material.

51. **How is the human hair used in the text to illustrate the small size of atoms? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** The text mentions that a human hair is about one million atoms wide, which helps illustrate just how incredibly small atoms are in comparison to the everyday objects we see.

52. **Describe how the composition of matter links to the concept of elements in everyday substances. (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** The composition of matter shows that everything around us—from water and air to trees and mountains—is built from atoms and molecules. These particles group together in specific ways to form elements and compounds, and even everyday substances like sand or copper are composed of one or more types of atoms that determine their properties.

53. **What does the text imply about the percentage of matter in the universe that is made up of atoms? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The text implies that atoms make up about 4 percent of the total matter in the universe, highlighting that there is much more than just atoms in the cosmic composition.

54. **Explain why the knowledge of atoms and molecules is fundamental to understanding chemistry. (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** Knowledge of atoms and molecules is fundamental because they are the building blocks of all matter. Understanding how they combine and interact is essential to explaining chemical reactions, the formation of compounds, and the physical and chemical properties of substances, which are the core topics of chemistry.

55. **Define what an element is in one sentence. (Marks: 1)**  
    **Answer:** An element is a pure substance made up of only one kind of atom.

56. **How do compounds differ from elements, based on the reading? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Compounds differ from elements in that compounds consist of two or more different types of atoms chemically combined, whereas elements contain only one type of atom.

57. **What role do atoms play in the formation of molecules? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** Atoms join together by forming bonds, and these bonds create molecules which are the smallest units of compounds.

58. **Why might it be said that the study of atoms is the study of everything around us? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Because atoms are the building blocks of all matter, studying them helps us understand the composition, behavior, and interactions of all substances in the universe, from the smallest particle to the largest structure.

59. **Using a simple example, describe what happens when two atoms combine to form a molecule. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** When two atoms, such as two oxygen atoms, combine they form a molecule of oxygen gas (O₂) through chemical bonding, giving the molecule properties that are different from the individual atoms.

60. **Summarize how the basic particles of matter contribute to its overall composition. (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** The overall composition of matter is built from the basic particles—atoms—that join to form molecules. These molecules can exist as pure elements or compounds, and their specific arrangement and combination determine the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance.

### **Section 4: States of Matter – Solids, Liquids, and Gases**

61. **List the three states of matter as mentioned in the text. (Marks: 1)**  
    **Answer:** The three states of matter are solids, liquids, and gases.

62. **What are the defining features of a solid? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** A solid has a definite shape and a fixed volume; its molecules are tightly packed and do not flow.

63. **State one characteristic of a liquid. (Marks: 1)**  
    **Answer:** A liquid takes the shape of its container but retains a fixed volume.

64. **Describe one key property of gases. (Marks: 1)**  
    **Answer:** Gases have no definite shape or volume; they expand to fill the entire container.

65. **Explain why a solid does not flow as a liquid does. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** A solid does not flow because its molecules are tightly packed and only vibrate in fixed positions, whereas in a liquid the molecules can move past each other, allowing the substance to flow.

66. **How does a liquid's behavior change when poured into a container of a different shape? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** When a liquid is poured into a different container, it takes on the new container’s shape while keeping the same volume.

67. **Give an example of a situation where the properties of a gas are clearly demonstrated. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** An example is opening a bottle of perfume and noticing how quickly the scent spreads throughout the room, showing that gas particles move fast and fill the available space.

68. **Why are liquids considered incompressible according to the text? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Liquids are considered incompressible because their molecules are already close together, so when pressure is applied, there is little space available for the molecules to be forced closer together.

69. **Summarize the main difference between liquids and gases in terms of their shape and volume. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container, whereas gases have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume and will expand to fill the container completely.

70. **What experiment can you perform to demonstrate that gases occupy space? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** One experiment is to invert an empty glass tumbler in a trough of water; the air trapped inside will prevent the water from filling the tumbler completely, showing that gas occupies space.

71. **Explain how surface tension is related to the properties of liquids. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Surface tension is a property of liquids where the surface molecules are attracted to each other, forming a sort of “film” on the surface. This is why small insects or bugs can walk on water without sinking.

72. **Why does a gas expand rapidly when heated? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** A gas expands rapidly when heated because the increased temperature causes the gas molecules to move faster and spread apart, taking up more space.

73. **Describe what happens to the state of matter when a solid is exposed to high temperature, based on the text. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** When a solid is exposed to a high temperature, its molecules begin to vibrate more vigorously and may eventually overcome the strong intermolecular forces, leading to a change of state such as melting into a liquid.

74. **How do the intermolecular forces in solids compare to those in gases? (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** In solids, the intermolecular forces are very strong because the molecules are very closely packed, whereas in gases, the intermolecular forces are negligibly small due to the large distances between the molecules.

75. **What property of liquids allows them to flow from higher elevations to lower elevations? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The ability of liquids to flow is due to the relatively loose arrangement and slight movement of their molecules compared to those in a solid.

76. **Summarize in one sentence why gases are compressible. (Marks: 1)**  
    **Answer:** Gases are compressible because their particles are spread far apart, allowing them to be forced closer together under pressure.

77. **List two properties that distinguish a liquid from a solid. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** A liquid does not have a fixed shape and can flow, whereas a solid has a definite shape and is rigid.

78. **Why is it said that gases have no free surface? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** It is said that gases have no free surface because unlike liquids, they completely fill the container they are in and do not form a top layer or surface when at rest.

79. **How do temperature changes affect the volume of a gas compared to a liquid? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Temperature changes affect the volume of a gas significantly because heating causes the gas molecules to move apart and expand, whereas a liquid’s volume changes very little due to its incompressible nature.

80. **Describe one real-life application of the compressibility of gases. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** One real-life application is in the use of compressed gas cylinders, like those used for cooking gas, where the gas is stored in a compressed state to make it easier to transport and use.

### **Section 5: Molecular Arrangement and the Properties Derived from Them**

81. **Describe the arrangement of molecules in a solid. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** In a solid, molecules are very tightly packed in a fixed arrangement with very small intermolecular distances, which gives the solid its rigid shape and fixed volume.

82. **How does the intermolecular distance in liquids compare to that in solids? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** In liquids, the intermolecular distance is greater than in solids, allowing the molecules to move past one another, whereas in solids, the molecules are packed very closely together.

83. **State one property of gas molecules that is highlighted in the text. (Marks: 1)**  
    **Answer:** Gas molecules move very fast and randomly, which causes gases to fill the entire container.

84. **Explain why solids expand very negligibly on heating. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Solids expand very negligibly on heating because their molecules are held tightly together by strong intermolecular forces, which do not allow much movement even when the temperature increases.

85. **How do intermolecular forces affect the compressibility of matter? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Strong intermolecular forces, as in solids and liquids, make the matter less compressible because the particles are already closely packed, while weaker forces in gases allow them to be compressed easily.

86. **Compare the motion of molecules in a solid and a gas. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** In a solid, molecules vibrate in fixed positions and have very limited movement, whereas in a gas, molecules move rapidly and randomly, filling the available space in a container.

87. **What do you understand by the term “intermolecular space” as used in the text? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** Intermolecular space refers to the area or distance between the molecules in a substance, which influences how tightly the molecules are packed and how they interact.

88. **Explain how the concept of intermolecular forces helps to distinguish between a solid, a liquid, and a gas. (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** The concept of intermolecular forces helps distinguish the three states of matter: in solids, the forces are very strong, keeping the molecules in fixed positions; in liquids, the forces are moderately strong, allowing the molecules to move around while still remaining close; and in gases, the forces are almost negligible, enabling the molecules to move freely and spread apart.

89. **State why liquids expand more than solids when heated. (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** Liquids expand more than solids when heated because the intermolecular forces in liquids are weaker, so the molecules move further apart with increased kinetic energy.

90. **Summarize how the arrangement of molecules determines the physical properties of matter. (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** The arrangement of molecules determines the physical properties by dictating how tightly the particles are packed and how they can move. In solids, closely packed molecules lead to rigidity and incompressibility; in liquids, the looser arrangement allows flow but maintains volume; and in gases, widely spaced molecules result in high compressibility and complete filling of the container.

91. **Identify one characteristic that is common to all three states of matter according to the experiments. (Marks: 1)**  
    **Answer:** One common characteristic is that all states of matter occupy space.

92. **Why do molecules in a gas have to move faster than those in a solid? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Molecules in a gas move faster than those in a solid because they are not held tightly by intermolecular forces, allowing them to have high kinetic energy and rapid, random motion in an open space.

93. **Explain in simple terms why the intermolecular forces in gases are said to be “negligibly small.” (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The intermolecular forces in gases are described as “negligibly small” because the gas molecules are so far apart that the attractive forces between them have very little effect on their movement.

94. **How does the text use everyday examples to explain the arrangement of molecules in different states? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** The text uses examples like a block of wood, water in various containers, and an inflated balloon to clearly show how particles behave differently—staying fixed in solids, flowing in liquids, and moving freely in gases.

95. **What does the rapid movement of gas molecules imply about its ability to mix with other gases? (Marks: 2)**  
    **Answer:** The rapid movement of gas molecules implies that they can mix very quickly with other gases, which is why a scent can spread throughout a room in only a few minutes.

96. **Using your own words, explain the effect of intermolecular space on the density of matter. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Intermolecular space affects density because when the molecules are closely packed, as in solids, the density is high; when there is more space between molecules, as in gases, the density is low.

97. **Why do solids have a fixed shape while liquids take the shape of their container? (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** Solids have a fixed shape because their molecules are locked together in a rigid structure, whereas liquids have a looser arrangement, allowing them to flow and conform to the shape of their container.

98. **Describe one experiment from the text that helps illustrate the concept of molecular arrangement in matter. (Marks: 3)**  
    **Answer:** One experiment is lowering a glass tumbler into a trough of water (Activity 4), which shows that the trapped air inside the tumbler occupies space and prevents water from entering completely, illustrating the arrangement of gas molecules and the concept of intermolecular space.

99. **How does the molecular arrangement explain the incompressibility of liquids? (Marks: 4)**  
    **Answer:** The molecular arrangement in liquids shows that the molecules are already close together, which leaves very little space for them to be pushed closer. This strong intermolecular interaction makes liquids largely incompressible under normal conditions.
