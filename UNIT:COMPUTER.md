## Section 1: Categories of Computers

**Introduction:**  
Just as you need a specific bat for cricket or a particular racquet for tennis, different types of computers are made for different purposes. Their differences lie in size, speed, storage capacity, and cost.
### 1.1 Microcomputers  
- **Definition:**  
  Microcomputers are small computers that work on a single microprocessor (a small chip that acts like the computer’s brain).  
- **Usage:**  
  They are used by one person at a time. Personal computers, desktops, laptops, and tablets all fall into this category.  
- **Example Brands:**  
  Dell, Apple, HP, and IBM produce these computers.

### 1.2 Minicomputers  
- **Definition:**  
  These computers have more processing power and memory than microcomputers.  
- **Usage:**  
  They can attach a large number of input and output devices and are used where more data storage and processing is needed.  
- **Examples:**  
  Systems such as the CDC 1700 and HP 3000.

### 1.3 Mainframe Computers  
- **Definition:**  
  Mainframe computers are very large, expensive, and powerful.  
- **Usage:**  
  They have huge memory and can be used by more than a hundred users simultaneously. Their tasks include handling thousands of calculations or instructions every second.  
- **Examples:**  
  IBM Z series is one example, and they are commonly used in big hospitals, airlines, and banks.

### 1.4 Supercomputers  
- **Definition:**  
  Supercomputers are the fastest and most powerful computers.  
- **Usage:**  
  They are used for complex tasks such as scientific research, weather forecasting, underground studies, and aircraft designing.  
- **Examples:**  
  Cray-1 and IBM’s Blue Gene/L.

### 1.5 Mobile Computers  
- **Definition:**  
  These are the smallest and lightest computers designed to be easily carried around.  
- **Types:**  
  - **Netbooks:** Small and low-powered notebooks (e.g., ASUS Eee PC).  
  - **E-book Readers:** Handheld devices for reading digital media (e.g., Paperwhite Kindle).  
  - **Tablets:** Portable computers with a touchscreen (e.g., Apple’s iPad, Microsoft Surface).  
  - **Smartphones:** Combine the functions of a phone and a computer to check emails, book tickets, and more.  
  - **PMPs (Portable Media Players):** Devices that store and play audio, images, and videos.

### 1.6 Game Consoles  
- **Definition:**  
  Game consoles are designed specifically for playing computer games on a television.  
- **Usage:**  
  They are operated using controllers (handheld devices with buttons).  
- **Examples:**  
  Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation, Nintendo GameCube, and Nintendo Wii.

### 1.7 Embedded Computers  
- **Definition:**  
  These are computers that are integrated into other devices to perform specific tasks. They are often also called microcontrollers.  
- **Usage:**  
  Embedded computers are used in modern devices such as TVs, washing machines, digital cameras, telephones, ATMs, and even digital watches and MP3 players.

## Section 2: Computer Languages

**Introduction:**  
While people communicate using languages like English, Hindi, or Tamil, computers do not understand these languages. Instead, they use their own special languages that are divided into different generations.

### 2.1 Low-Level Languages  
Low-level languages are very close to the way the computer actually works.

#### a. Machine Language (First Generation Language)  
- **Definition:**  
  Machine language is the basic language of computers. It is made up entirely of 0s and 1s.  
- **Key Points:**  
  - It is the only language that a computer can understand directly.  
  - Programs written in machine language run very fast because they require no further translation.  
  - However, it is very hard for humans to read and write

#### b. Assembly Language (Second Generation Language)  
- **Definition:**  
  Assembly language is very similar to machine language but uses symbols, numbers, and abbreviations instead of long strings of 0s and 1s.  
- **Key Points:**  
  - It is easier for humans to understand than pure machine language.  
  - Each computer has its own assembly language, so it remains machine dependent.  
  - It allows the programmer to locate and correct errors more easily.

### 2.2 High-Level Languages (Third Generation Languages)  
- **Definition:**  
  High-level languages are like human languages. They are more user-friendly and easier to write and read.  
- **Examples:**  
  Languages such as C, C++, C#, FORTRAN, BASIC, and COBOL.  
- **Key Points:**  
  - They must be translated into machine language by a translator (compiler or interpreter) before they can be executed by the computer.
  - Their ease of use makes programming faster and less prone to errors.

### 2.3 Fourth Generation Languages (4GLs)  
- **Definition:**  
  Fourth generation languages are modern, high-level languages designed to be very close to human language.  
- **Examples:**  
  PL/SQL, FoxPro, Stata, and Oracle.  
- **Ke Points:**  
  - They are more user-friendly and allow programmers to write code quickly.  
  - They have a very high speed of execution compared to older languges.
  
### 2.4 Fifth Generation Languages (5GLs) – Artificial Intelligence Languages  
- **Definition:**  
  Fifth generation languages are used to develop programs based on Artificial Intelligence.  
- **Key Points:**  
  - Their main aim is to solve problems without needing the programmer to specify every detail of the algorithm.  
  - They help the computer to “think,” behave, and react like a human.  
- **Examples:**  
  Mercury, OPSS, and Prolog.

## Section 3: Working of a Translator

**Introduction:**  
Since the computer only understands machine language (the language of 0s and 1s), any program written in a high-level language must be converted or “translated” into machine code. This is done with a tool called a translator.

### 3.1 Types of Translators

#### a. Assembler  
- **Definition:**  
  An assembler is a translator that converts a program written in assembly language into machine language.

#### b. Compiler  
- **Definition:**  
  A compiler translates an entire program written in a high-level language into machine language all at once.  
- **Key Points:**  
  - The entire program is translated in one go.  
  - Errors are detected after the whole program is compiled, which can make debugging a bit challenging.

#### c. Interpreter  
- **Definition:**  
  An interpreter translates a high-level language program into machine language one line at a time.  
- **Key Points:**  
  - It immediately reports any error as soon as it occurs.  
  - This line-by-line process makes it easier to locate and fix errors.

# Computer: File Management and Data Organization - unit

Imagine your computer as a well-organized supermarket where every item is neatly arranged. In a computer, pictures, presentations, or documents are saved as files, and these files are kept in specific places or folders on different drives. Organising these files is called **file management**. It includes tasks like copying, moving, storing, and searching files and folders.

### 1. Copying and Moving Data from One Drive to Another

#### Copying Data  
- **What It Means:**  
  Copying creates a duplicate of the file or folder. The original file remains in its place, and the copy is placed in a new location.  

- **Steps to Copy a File or Folder:**  
  1. Open **File Explorer** and find the file or folder you want to copy.  
  2. Right-click on it and select the **Copy** option.  
  3. Open the drive or folder where you want the copy to go.  
  4. Right-click on an empty space and select **Paste**.  
     
  *The file or folder will now appear in the new location as well as in the original one.*

#### Moving Data  
- **What It Means:**  
  Moving a file or folder is similar to copying, but the file is removed from its original location and appears only in the new destination.

- **Steps to Move a File or Folder:**  
  1. Open **File Explorer** and locate the file or folder you wish to move.  
  2. Right-click on it and select **Cut**.  
  3. Open the drive or folder where you want to place it.  
  4. Right-click in the new location and select **Paste**.  
     
  *The file or folder is now moved to the new location and is no longer in its original place.*

### 2. Moving Data Between Storage Devices

#### Understanding Storage Devices  
Storage devices are hardware units like CDs, DVDs, and pen drives, which are used to store data. Transferring data from your computer to one of these devices is known as writing or burning data.

#### Burning a CD/DVD  
- **What It Means:**  
  Burning a disc means writing data such as text, songs, movies, or images onto a CD or DVD.

- **Steps to Burn a CD/DVD:**  
  1. Insert a blank rewritable CD/DVD (CD-RW/DVD-RW) into the drive.  
  2. A dialog box appears. Enter a name for the disc in the **Disc title** field.  
  3. With the default option selected, click **Next**.  
  4. The disc drive opens on the screen; copy and paste the files from your computer that you want to store on the disc.  
  5. Click the **Finish burning** button in the Drive Tools tab.  
  6. A dialog box appears; click **Next**.  
     
  *Remember: The “RW” means **Rewritable**—you can add or remove files later.*

#### Copying Data from a Pen Drive  
- **Steps to Copy Files from a Pen Drive:**  
  1. Insert the pen drive into your computer. A window will appear showing the data stored on the pen drive.  
  2. Locate the file or folder on your computer that you want to copy.  
  3. Right-click on it and choose **Copy**.  
  4. Open the folder that represents the pen drive.  
  5. Right-click on an empty space in the pen drive and select **Paste**.  
  6. To safely remove the pen drive, click the pen drive icon in the taskbar’s notification area and select **Eject**.  
     
  *This process copies your selected file or folder onto the pen drive.*

### 3. Working with Multiple Applications

Modern computers can run several programs at the same time. For instance, you can work on a document while listening to music simultaneously.

#### How to Use Multiple Applications  
1. Open a web browser to search for information.  
2. Open another application, like a music player, to play your favorite songs.  
3. Right-click on the taskbar and select **Show windows side by side**.  
   *This will arrange the open application windows next to each other.*  
4. To go back to a single window arrangement, right-click the taskbar again and select **Undo Show all windows side by side**.

*This feature lets you multitask easily by viewing more than one application on your screen at the same time.*

### 4. Searching Files Using Wildcard Characters

Sometimes you may not remember the exact name of a file. Wildcard characters help you search even if you don’t know the complete file name.

#### What Are Wildcard Characters?  
- **Asterisk (*)**  
  - This character represents one or more unknown characters.  
  - **Example:** Typing `class*` in the search bar will show files like `class`, `classroom`, `classwork`, etc. You can narrow the search by typing something like `class*.doc` to find files that start with “class” and end with the extension `.doc` or `.docx`.

- **Question Mark (?)**  
  - his character represents exactly one unknown character.  
  - **Example:** Typing `d?ll.docx` will find files like `doll.docx` or `dull.docx`, but not a file like `dollar.docx`. You can use more than one question mark if you need to substitute for multiple characters

### 5. Different File Formats

Files on a computer can store different types of data. Each type of file is saved in a specific format, which is usually identified by its file extension. This helps the computer know which program to use to open the file.

#### Common File Formats  
- **JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg, .jpe):**  
  Used for storing pictures.  
- **MP3 (.mp3):**  
  An audio file format used for storing music and sound.  
- **MP4 (.mp4):**  
  A multimedia file format used for storing video and audio, sometimes with subtitles.  
- **DOCX (.docx):**  
  The default format for Microsoft Word documents, containing text, images, tables, and charts.  
- **XLSX (.xlsx):**  
  The default file format for Microsoft Excel, used to store data in tables of rows and columns.

*Knowing these file formats helps you quickly decide which program you need to open a file.*
