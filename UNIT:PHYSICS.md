# PHYSICS: MATTER [UNIT]

## Section 1: What Is Matter?

**Definition of Matter:**  
- **Matter** is defined as anything that has mass and occupies space.  
- In simple words, everything you see around you—a chair, bullock cart, cycle, cooking utensils, books, clothes, toys, water, and even the air—consists of matter because each takes up space (has volume) and has weight (mass).

**Key Points:**  
- **Mass:** Because every object has mass, it can be weighed (for example, using a spring balance).  
- **Volume:** Since matter occupies space, it has a measurable volume.

## Section 2: How Do We Know Matter Has Mass and Volume?

This Section uses everyday experiments to show that solids, liquids, and even air (a gas) all have mass and occupy space.

### **Activity 1: Studying Solids and Liquids**
- **Procedure:**  
  - Suspend an empty plastic beaker from a spring balance and note its weight.
  - Fill the beaker with water and observe that the spring balance shows more weight.
- **Observation:**  
  - Water adds weight because it has mass.
  - When the experiment is repeated with sand or pebbles, the spring balance shows an even greater weight.
- **Conclusion:**  
  - Both solids and liquids have weight and thus have mass.

### **Activity 2: Studying That Air Has Mass**
- **Procedure:**  
  - Inflate two similar balloons equally and balance them on a half-meter scale.
  - Heat the tip of a long iron needle and use it to pop one balloon.
- **Observation:**  
  - When the balloon bursts, the scale tilts toward the intact balloon.
- **Conclusion:**  
  - The air that escapes had weight. This shows that even air (a gas) has mass.

### **Activity 3: Showing That Solids and Liquids Occupy Space**
- **Procedure:**  
  - Place a glass tumbler in a bowl and fill it with water.
  - Lower a small stone tied to a thread into the tumbler.
- **Observation:**  
  - Water overflows from the tumbler because the stone occupies space.
  - After removing the stone, the water level drops, confirming that the stone took up some of the tumbler’s space.
- **Conclusion:**  
  - Both the stone (a solid) and the water (a liquid) occupy space.

### **Activity 4: Demonstrating That Gases Occupy Space**
- **Procedure:**  
  - Lower an empty glass tumbler vertically into a trough of water.
- **Observation:**  
  - The water level inside the tumbler is lower than outside because the trapped air prevents the water from rising.
  - Tilting the tumbler causes bubbles of air to escape, and water fills the space.
- **Conclusion:**  
  - Air, which is a gas, occupies space just like solids and liquids.

## Section 3: Composition of Matter

**How Matter Is Made Up:**  
- Matter is composed of extremely small particles called **molecules**.  
- **Molecules** are, in turn, made up of even smaller particles called **atoms**.

**Key Terms and Their Meanings:**  
- **Atom:**  
  - It is the smallest unit of matter.  
  - An atom cannot be split apart by normal chemical or physical processes and takes part in chemical reactions.
- **Molecule:**  
  - It is the smallest particle of a substance that can exist on its own.
  - Molecules can be made of one, two, or more atoms.  
  - If a molecule is made up of one atom, it is called **mono-atomic**; if it is made of two atoms, it is **di-atomic**; and if more than two, it is **poly-atomic**.

**Interesting Facts:**  
- A human hair is about one million atoms in width.
- There are 28 different kinds of atoms in the human body.
- Elements are pure substances that consist of only one type of atom (e.g., hydrogen, nitrogen).

## Section 4: States of Matter – Solids, Liquids, and Gases

Matter exists in three states depending on how its particles are arranged and how strongly they stick together.  

### **Solids**
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Have a **definite shape** (they keep their shape no matter the container).  
  - Have a **definite volume** (their amount of space does not change).  
  - The particles (molecules) are very tightly packed and can only vibrate in place.
  - **Examples:** Wooden chairs, tables, fans, and other rigid objects.
- **Key Properties:**  
  - Cannot be compressed.
  - Do not flow.
  - Do not need a container to hold them.

### **Liquids**
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Have a **definite volume** but **no definite shape**; they take the shape of the container.
  - Particles in liquids are less tightly packed than in solids and can slide past each other.
  - They have a **free surface** (the top is flat) when placed in a container.
- **Key Properties:**  
  - Not easily compressible.
  - Flow from higher to lower places.
  - Show surface tension (a force that holds the surface molecules together).
- **Examples:** Water, milk, and other common liquids.

### **Gases**
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Do not have a definite shape or volume; they expand to fill any container.
  - Particles are very far apart compared to solids and liquids.
  - They move rapidly and mix easily with one another (as seen when perfume spreads in a room).
- **Key Properties:**  
  - Highly compressible.
  - Fill the entire available space.
  - Do not have a free surface (unless they condense to form droplets).

## Section 5: Arrangement of Molecules and Intermolecular Forces

**How Molecules Are Arranged:**  
- In **solids**, molecules are packed very close together. The forces of attraction (cohesion) are very strong, so the molecules do not slide over each other.
- In **liquids**, molecules are still close but have more space than in solids. They can move past each other, which is why liquids can flow.
- In **gases**, molecules are very far apart, and the forces between them are almost negligible. This allows gas molecules to move freely and be compressed easily.

**Intermolecular Forces:**  
- **Cohesion:** The force of attraction between similar molecules.  
- **Adhesion:** The force of attraction between dissimilar molecules.
- These forces determine the state in which matter exists. For example, strong intermolecular forces make a substance a solid, while weak forces allow it to be a gas.

## Section 6: Properties of Solids, Liquids, and Gases

Each state of matter exhibits unique properties because of differences in molecular arrangement and intermolecular forces.

| **Molecular Movement**          | Only vibrate in place                                | Molecules translate and vibrate                     | Molecules move freely and quickly                  |
| **Expansion on Heating**        | Expand very little                                   | Expand more than solids                             | Expand very easily and a lot                       |

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Solids:** Tight bonding and little space between molecules make them rigid.  
- **Liquids:** Some extra space allows them to flow, yet they remain largely incompressible.  
- **Gases:** Large spaces between particles allow them to move freely, fill containers, and be easily compressed.

**Q43. How does the experiment using a glass tumbler and a stone prove that solids occupy space? [2 marks]**  
The experiment proves that solids occupy space because when a stone is submerged in water, it displaces water, causing some water to overflow.

**Q44. What observation confirms that liquids have a definite volume? [2 marks]**  
The observation that when a liquid is poured from one container to another, its amount remains the same confirms that liquids have a definite volume.

**Q45. Why can gases be compressed much more than liquids? [3 marks]**  
Gases can be compressed much more than liquids because the molecules in a gas are spread far apart, leaving plenty of empty space that can be reduced under pressure.

**Q46. What experiment demonstrates that liquids are not compressible? [2 marks]**  
Using a sealed syringe filled with water, it is observed that when pressure is applied by pushing the plunger, the volume of water does not change, which shows that liquids are not compressible.

**Q47. What does the term “surface tension” refer to in liquids? [2 marks]**  
Surface tension refers to the force of attraction among the molecules at the surface of a liquid, causing them to stick together and form a smooth surface.

**Q48. How does the experiment with the glass tumbler and water demonstrate that air occupies space? [3 marks]**  
The experiment demonstrates that air occupies space because when a glass tumbler is lowered vertically into a trough of water, the water level inside the tumbler is lower than the water level outside due to the trapped air.

**Q49. What is observed when bubbles of air are released from a tilted tumbler? [1 mark]**  
When bubbles of air are released from a tilted tumbler, it is observed that water flows in to take the place of the exiting air.

**Q50. Summarize the conclusion reached from the experiments on solids, liquids, and gases. [3 marks]**

### **Section 5: Characteristics of Solids, Liquids, and Gases (Comparative Properties)**

**Q51. List two defining properties of solids. [2 marks]**  
Solids have a definite shape and a definite volume.

**Q52. What does it mean when we say liquids do not have a definite shape? [2 marks]**  
It means that liquids take the shape of the container they are placed in instead of keeping their own fixed shape.

**Q53. How do gases differ in shape compared to solids and liquids? [2 marks]**  
Gases differ because they do not have any definite shape and expand to fill the entire container they are in.

**Q54. Compare the compressibility of solids, liquids, and gases. [3 marks]**  
Solids cannot be compressed at all, liquids are only slightly compressible, and gases are highly compressible due to the large spaces between their molecules.

**Q55. Why do liquids have a free and flat surface when at rest? [2 marks]**  
Liquids have a free and flat surface because the molecules at the top are not constrained by the container’s sides, so they naturally form a level surface.

**Q56. What property of gases allows perfume to be smelled throughout a room? [3 marks]**  
The property is that gases, because their molecules move freely and mix easily, can spread a scent like perfume throughout an entire room.

**Q57. How do the intermolecular distances in solids compare to those in gases? [2 marks]**  
In solids, the intermolecular distances are very small, while in gases, the distances between molecules are very large.

**Q58. What happens to the molecules in a solid when heat is applied? [3 marks]**

**Q59. Explain how the property of surface tension in liquids is demonstrated in everyday life. [3 marks]**  
Surface tension is demonstrated in everyday life when water forms droplets and when bugs are able to walk on the surface of water because the molecules stick together at the surface.

**Q60. How does the table of properties help us differentiate between the three states of matter? [4 marks]**  
The table helps differentiate the states of matter by comparing properties such as intermolecular forces, shape, volume, compressibility, and molecular motion; showing that solids are rigid, liquids flow and have a constant volume, and gases expand to fill the container.

### **Section 6: Intermolecular Forces and Molecular Arrangement**

**Q61. What are intermolecular forces of attraction? [2 marks]**  
Intermolecular forces of attraction are the forces that hold molecules together by attracting them to one another.

**Q62. Differentiate between cohesion and adhesion. [3 marks]**  
Cohesion is the force of attraction between similar molecules, while adhesion is the force of attraction between different or dissimilar molecules.

**Q63. How does the intermolecular space affect the state of matter? [3 marks]**  
The intermolecular space is the gap between molecules, and when this space is small, matter tends to be a solid; when it is larger, matter can be a liquid or gas.

**Q64. Why do solids expand negligibly on heating? [2 marks]**  
Solids expand negligibly on heating because their molecules are tightly packed together by strong intermolecular forces, leaving little space for expansion.

**Q65. In which state of matter are the intermolecular forces negligibly small? [1 mark]**  
Intermolecular forces are negligibly small in gases.

**Q66. How are molecules arranged in a liquid compared to a solid? [3 marks]**  
In a liquid, molecules are arranged with more space between them and can slide past each other, while in a solid, they are arranged in a fixed, closely packed structure.

**Q67. Explain why gases are easily compressible. [2 marks]**  
Gases are easily compressible because there is a large amount of empty space between the molecules, which can be reduced when pressure is applied.

**Q68. Describe the motion of molecules in a gas. [2 marks]**  
Molecules in a gas move randomly and rapidly in all directions, which is why a gas fills the entire volume of its container.

**Q69. What is the effect of intermolecular forces on the state of matter? [3 marks]**  
Stronger intermolecular forces in a substance help maintain a rigid structure as seen in solids, while weaker forces allow liquids to flow and gases to expand to fill their container.

**Q70. Summarize the importance of intermolecular forces in determining the properties of matter. [4 marks]**  
Intermolecular forces are important because they determine how closely molecules are held together, which in turn influences the state of matter, its compressibility, shape, volume, and how it responds to changes in temperature.

**Q71: Define cohesion and adhesion. [4 marks]**
- Cohesion: This is the force of attraction between similar molecules. For example, the water molecules stick together due to cohesion.
- Adhesion: This is the force of attraction between dissimilar molecules. For instance, water molecules can stick to the surface of a glass due to adhesion.
