## Summary
The poet walks alone, similar to a solitary cloud in the sky floating over hills and valleys. Suddenly, the poet sees a long and bustling row of daffodils. They are near the lake and the trees and flutter and shift as they are blown by the breeze.

Comparing the daffodils to stars in the sky, the poet notes how the flowers seem to go on without ending, alongside a bay. The poet guesses there are ten thousand or so daffodils, all of their heads moving as if they were dancing.

Near the daffodils, the waves are glinting on the bay. But the daffodils seem more joyful to the poet than the waves. A poet couldn't help being cheerful, says the poet, in the cheerful company of the daffodils. The poet stares at the daffodils lingeringly, without yet realizing the full extent of the positive effects of encountering them.

After the experience with the daffodils, the poet often lies on the couch, either absent-minded or thoughtful. It is then that the daffodils come back to the poet's imaginative memory—access to which is a gift of solitude—and fills the poet with joy as his mind dances with the daffodils.
