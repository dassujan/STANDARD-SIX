# PHYSICS: MATTER [UNIT]

### 1. What Is Matter?

**Definition:**  
- **Matter** is anything that has mass (weight) and takes up space (volume).  
- Everything you see around you—a chair, a book, water, air, and even the toys you play with—are made of matter.

**Key Points:**  
- **Mass:** Shows how much "stuff" is in an object.  
- **Volume:** Tells you how much space the object occupies.

**In Simple Terms:**  
Matter is like the "stuff" that makes up everything. If you can see it or feel it, and it fills up some space, it is matter.

### 2. Activities to Demonstrate the Properties of Matter

### Activity 2.1: Weight of Solids and Liquids

- **Objective:**  
  To show that both solids and liquids have weight (mass).

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - An empty plastic beaker is tied and suspended on a spring balance to record its weight.
  - When water is poured into the beaker, the reading on the spring balance increases.
  - Repeating the experiment with sand and pebbles further shows that these substances also register a weight—often more than water.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  Solids (sand, pebbles) and liquids (water) both possess weight and, therefore, mass.

### Activity 2.2: Demonstrating That Air Has Mass

- **Objective:**  
  To reveal that even air, though not visible, has mass.

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - Two equally inflated balloons are balanced on opposite sides of a half-meter scale.
  - Heating the tip of an iron needle and then touching one of the balloons causes it to burst. Air escapes from the burst balloon.
  - The scale tilts towards the side with the intact balloon, indicating a reduction in weight on the side of the burst balloon.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  The difference in weight demonstrates that the air in the balloon has mass. When some air is lost, the mass decreases, changing the balance.

### Activity 2.3: Showing that Solids and Liquids Occupy Space

- **Objective:**  
  To illustrate that any substance—whether solid or liquid—occupies space.

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - A glass tumbler is placed inside a bowl and filled with water.
  - When a small stone, tied with a thread, is lowered into the water in the tumbler, some water overflows, showing that the stone occupies space.
  - Removing the stone causes the water level to drop, and pouring the overflow water back confirms that the original volume of the tumbler remains constant.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  Both the stone (a solid) and water (a liquid) show that matter occupies space.

### Activity 2.4: Proving Gases Occupy Space

- **Objective:**  
  To demonstrate that gases (specifically air) also occupy space.

- **Procedure & Observations:**  
  - An empty glass tumbler is inverted into a trough of water. Despite being completely submerged, the water level inside the tumbler is lower than the water outside.
  - This difference is due to the air trapped inside the tumbler, which prevents water from filling the entire volume.
  - Tilting the tumbler causes air bubbles to escape, and water then flows in to replace them.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  The trapped air shows that gases occupy space.

### 3. Composition of Matter

Everything in our world is made of tiny particles:
- **Atoms:**  
  - The smallest unit of matter.
  - Atoms cannot be split by normal physical or chemical means.
- **Molecules:**  
  - Groups of atoms bonded together.
  - A molecule can have one, two, or many atoms. For example, water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

**In Simple Terms:**  
Imagine atoms as small building blocks. Molecules are made when two or more of these building blocks come together. All objects, whether they are solids, liquids, or gases, are made up of these tiny particles.

### 4. States of Matter

Matter can exist in three common states: **solids, liquids, and gases**. Each state has different properties.

### Solids
- **Properties:**
  - **Definite Shape and Volume:** Solids do not change shape. A chair or table always stays the same shape.
  - **Incompressible:** The particles are packed tightly together, so you cannot easily compress them.
  - **Fixed Arrangement:** The particles only vibrate in place and do not slide around.
- **Everyday Example:**  
  A block of wood or a toy car always keeps its shape.

### Liquids
- **Properties:**
  - **Definite Volume but No Fixed Shape:** Liquids always occupy the same amount of space, but they take the shape of their container.  
  - **Flow Easily:** The particles move past each other, which makes liquids flow.
  - **Incompressible:** Liquids cannot be compressed easily.
  - **Free Surface:** When a liquid is in a container, it always has a flat top surface.
- **Everyday Example:**  
  Water in a glass takes the shape of the glass, but it always remains the same amount of water.

### Gases
- **Properties:**
  - **No Definite Shape or Volume:** Gases fill the container they are in, whether it is a balloon or a room.
  - **Highly Compressible:** There is a lot of empty space between the particles, so gases can be compressed easily.
  - **Rapid and Random Motion:** The particles move very fast in every direction.
- **Everyday Example:**  
  The air we breathe fills up the entire room, no matter the shape of the room.

### 5. Why Do Matter’s States Behave Differently?

The differences come from two factors:

1. **Intermolecular Forces:**  
   These are the forces that hold the particles (atoms or molecules) together.
   - **Solids:** Have very strong forces; particles are stuck together in a fixed pattern.
   - **Liquids:** Have intermediate forces; particles are close but can move around each other.
   - **Gases:** Have very weak forces; particles move freely with lots of space in between.

2. **Intermolecular Space:**  
   This is the space between the particles.
   - **Solids:** Particles are very close with almost no empty space.
   - **Liquids:** There is a little space between particles.
   - **Gases:** Particles are far apart, which is why gases expand to fill any container.

### 6. Quick Comparison of Solids, Liquids, and Gases

   **Answer:** Matter is defined as anything that has mass and occupies space.

2. **Question:** Explain why matter is said to occupy space. [Marks: 2]  
   **Answer:** Matter occupies space because every material body takes up space, which means it has a certain volume.

3. **Question:** How can we define matter based on its weight and volume? [Marks: 3]  
   **Answer:** Matter can be defined as anything that not only has weight (and hence mass) but also occupies space, meaning it takes up a specific volume.

4. **Question:** What does it mean when we say an object has mass? [Marks: 1]  
   **Answer:** When an object has mass, it means it contains a certain amount of material that can be measured by its weight.

5. **Question:** Explain the relationship between mass and volume for any object. [Marks: 2]  
   **Answer:** Every object with mass occupies a certain amount of space, meaning it has volume, so mass and volume always go together when we talk about matter.

6. **Question:** Summarize the definition of matter using your own words. [Marks: 3]  
   **Answer:** Matter is any substance or material that has weight and volume, meaning it can be detected because it takes up space.

7. **Question:** List two reasons why matter can be detected. [Marks: 4]  
   **Answer:** Matter can be detected because it has mass, meaning it has weight, and it occupies space, meaning it has a definite volume.

8. **Question:** Compare matter and energy based on the text provided. [Marks: 5]  
   **Answer:** Unlike some forms of energy such as electricity, which do not take up space in the same way, matter can be detected easily because it has both weight and volume; this means every material object is made of matter, while energy may not exhibit these physical properties in the same manner.

9. **Question:** Why is it stated that matter takes up space? [Marks: 2]  
   **Answer:** It is stated that matter takes up space because every physical object, whether solid, liquid, or gas, occupies a certain volume in its surroundings.

10. **Question:** Identify one property of matter mentioned in the lesson. [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** One key property of matter is that it has mass.

## **Section 2: Experiments on Weight, Mass, and Occupying Space**

11. **Question:** What is the purpose of tying a plastic beaker to a cotton thread and suspending it from a spring balance in Activity 1? [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** The purpose is to measure the weight of the beaker and its contents to show that solids and liquids have mass.

12. **Question:** In Activity 1, what observation is made when water is poured into the beaker? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** When water is poured into the beaker, the spring balance shows an increased weight, indicating that water has mass.

13. **Question:** Describe the conclusion drawn from comparing the weights of water, sand, and pebbles in the beaker experiment. [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** The conclusion is that different substances have weight and mass, and when materials like sand and pebbles are added, the weight increases more than when water is used, showing that each substance has its own mass.

14. **Question:** What does the tilting of the half meter scale indicate in Activity 2 after puncturing one balloon? [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** The tilting of the scale indicates that the balloon that remains inflated has more mass because the air from the punctured balloon is lost.

15. **Question:** Explain the significance of the experiment with two equally inflated balloons on a half meter scale. [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** The experiment shows that when two balloons are equally inflated, they balance each other on the scale, which demonstrates that air in both balloons has mass.

16. **Question:** How does Activity 3 using a glass tumbler and a stone demonstrate that solids and liquids occupy space? [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** In Activity 3, when a stone is lowered into a glass tumbler filled with water and causes water to overflow, it shows that both the stone (a solid) and water (a liquid) take up space.

17. **Question:** What are the observations and conclusions from Activity 4 regarding gases? [Marks: 4]  
    **Answer:** In Activity 4, a glass tumbler is lowered in water, and the water level inside remains lower because the trapped air occupies space; when the tumbler is tilted, air bubbles escape and water fills in, confirming that gases also occupy space.

18. **Question:** Discuss how the experiments provided (Activities 1 to 4) demonstrate that all material bodies have mass and occupy space. [Marks: 5]  
    **Answer:** The experiments show that whether dealing with solids, liquids, or gases, each material body shows mass by registering weight on a spring balance or scale, and each occupies space as seen from displacement in water or the complete filling of a container, confirming the universal properties of matter.

19. **Question:** Why is it important to ensure the beaker is completely filled when pouring water in Activity 1? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** It is important because a completely filled beaker ensures that the full weight contribution of the liquid is measured, clearly demonstrating that the liquid has mass.

20. **Question:** Name one piece of equipment used in the experiments in Section 2. [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** One piece of equipment used is the spring balance.

## **Section 3: Composition of Matter: Atoms and Molecules**

21. **Question:** What is the smallest unit of matter? [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** The smallest unit of matter is the atom.

22. **Question:** Explain what molecules are as described in the lesson. [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** Molecules are extremely small particles that are made up of atoms and have all the properties of the substance they form.

23. **Question:** How is an atom different from a molecule? [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** An atom is the smallest unit of an element that cannot be split by normal chemical or physical processes, whereas a molecule is composed of two or more atoms bonded together and represents the smallest unit of a compound.

24. **Question:** Can an atom be split by normal chemical or physical processes? [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** No, an atom cannot be split by normal chemical or physical processes.

25. **Question:** How are elements defined in the context of atoms? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** Elements are defined as substances that are made up of only one type of atom, meaning every atom in the element is identical.

26. **Question:** What is the difference between substances made of one type of atom and those with more than one type of atoms? [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** Substances made of one type of atom are called elements, such as hydrogen gas, while substances made of more than one type of atom are called compounds, like sand which contains both oxygen and silicon atoms.

27. **Question:** Provide examples of elements and substances that contain more than one kind of atom from the text. [Marks: 4]  
    **Answer:** For example, hydrogen is an element because it is made of the same kind of atoms, whereas sand is a substance containing more than one kind of atom, specifically oxygen and silicon.

28. **Question:** Summarize the composition of matter and explain how molecules and atoms contribute to this composition. [Marks: 5]  
    **Answer:** Matter is composed of very tiny particles called molecules, and each molecule is made up of atoms; atoms are the building blocks of matter, and depending on how they bond, they form different molecules which in turn make up the various substances around us.

29. **Question:** What proportion of the universe's total matter is made up of atoms, as mentioned in the lesson? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** Atoms make up about 4 percent of the total matter of the universe.

30. **Question:** State one key idea about the composition of matter. [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** One key idea is that everything around us is made up of atoms and molecules.

## **Section 4: States of Matter and Their Characteristics**

31. **Question:** Define a solid based on the text. [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** A solid is a state of matter that has a definite shape and a definite volume.

32. **Question:** How does a liquid differ from a gas in terms of shape? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** A liquid takes the shape of its container because it has no definite shape, whereas a gas not only takes the shape but also completely fills the container.

33. **Question:** Explain the characteristics of a solid, including its shape and volume. [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** A solid has a definite shape and a fixed volume because its molecules are tightly packed together, meaning it does not flow or change shape under normal conditions.

34. **Question:** What type of shape do gases have in a container? [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** Gases have no definite shape; they fill the entire shape of the container.

35. **Question:** Why can a liquid take the shape of the container it is in? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** A liquid takes the shape of its container because its molecules are not as tightly packed as in a solid, allowing it to flow and conform to the container’s form.

36. **Question:** List three properties that distinguish gases from solids and liquids. [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** Gases have no fixed shape or volume, they are easily compressible, and they spread out to fill the entire available space.

37. **Question:** Describe the free surface characteristic of a liquid and its importance. [Marks: 4]  
    **Answer:** A liquid has a free, flat surface when at rest because the molecules are free to move, which is important for creating a level surface that does not change unless disturbed.

38. **Question:** Compare and contrast the states of matter (solids, liquids, and gases) based on their shapes, volumes, and compressibility. [Marks: 5]  
    **Answer:** Solids have a definite shape and volume and are not compressible because their molecules are tightly packed; liquids have a definite volume but no fixed shape and are only slightly compressible; gases have neither a fixed shape nor volume and are highly compressible as their molecules are far apart.

39. **Question:** What does it mean when we say liquids are "not compressible"? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** It means that when pressure is applied to a liquid, its volume does not change significantly because the particles are already close together.

40. **Question:** Identify one property of gases mentioned in the lesson. [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** One property of gases is that they can be compressed easily.

## **Section 5: Molecular Arrangement and Intermolecular Forces**

41. **Question:** What is meant by the term "intermolecular forces"? [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** Intermolecular forces are the attractions that act between the molecules of a substance.

42. **Question:** Differentiate between the forces of cohesion and adhesion. [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** Cohesion is the force of attraction between similar molecules, whereas adhesion is the force of attraction between different molecules.

43. **Question:** How does the intermolecular space affect the forces of attraction between molecules? [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** The intermolecular space determines the strength of the attraction; when the space between molecules is small, the forces of attraction are strong, and when the space is large, the forces are very weak.

44. **Question:** Why are the intermolecular forces very strong in solids? [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** They are very strong in solids because the molecules are packed very closely together, allowing for strong attractions.

45. **Question:** What happens to the molecules in a liquid compared to those in a solid? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** In a liquid, the molecules are still close together but can move past one another, unlike in a solid where they remain fixed in their positions.

46. **Question:** Explain why gases can be easily compressed based on their molecular arrangement. [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** Gases can be easily compressed because their molecules are very far apart, leaving a lot of space that can be reduced when pressure is applied.

47. **Question:** Describe how intermolecular forces vary among solids, liquids, and gases. [Marks: 4]  
    **Answer:** In solids, intermolecular forces are very strong due to close packing of molecules; in liquids, the forces are moderate, allowing flow; and in gases, the forces are negligibly small because the molecules are widely separated.

48. **Question:** Discuss how the arrangement and spacing of molecules in a substance determine whether it is a solid, liquid, or gas. [Marks: 5]  
    **Answer:** The state of a substance depends on how closely the molecules are arranged; in solids, molecules are tightly packed with strong attraction, in liquids they are moderately spaced allowing movement, and in gases they are far apart with almost no attraction, which explains differences in shape, volume, and compressibility.

49. **Question:** What is the relationship between intermolecular distance and compressibility? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** The greater the intermolecular distance, the more compressible the substance is, as seen in gases where molecules are far apart.

50. **Question:** Name one consequence of weak intermolecular forces in gases. [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** One consequence is that gases expand very easily to fill the available space.

## **Section 6: Additional Conceptual Questions and Summary**

51. **Question:** Why does a solid not change its shape at room temperature? [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** A solid does not change its shape because its molecules are fixed in place and cannot move freely.

52. **Question:** In your own words, explain why liquids do not have a definite shape. [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** Liquids do not have a definite shape because their molecules can move and slide past each other, so they take the shape of the container they are in.

53. **Question:** Summarize the process and result of pouring water from a bowl into a glass tumbler as described in the lesson. [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** When water is poured from a bowl into a glass tumbler that was previously filled by a stone, water flows back into the tumbler until it is completely filled, demonstrating that both the water and the stone occupy space.

54. **Question:** What observation is made when a gas occupies the entire volume of a container? [Marks: 1]  
    **Answer:** When a gas occupies the entire volume of a container, it completely fills the available space regardless of the container’s shape.

55. **Question:** How does the experiment involving perfume in a room illustrate the properties of gases? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** The perfume experiment shows that gas molecules spread out and mix with air quickly, filling the entire room with scent.

56. **Question:** Explain the concept of surface tension and its effect on liquids. [Marks: 3]  
    **Answer:** Surface tension is a force that pulls the molecules of a liquid together at its surface, which helps maintain a flat and stable surface, like how water remains level in an open container.

57. **Question:** Why do liquids have a free surface that is flat in the experiments described? [Marks: 4]  
    **Answer:** Liquids have a flat free surface because the molecules at the top experience balanced forces, resulting in a level surface that stays constant unless acted upon by an external force.

58. **Question:** Analyze how the experiments and the arrangement of molecules lead to the conclusion that matter exists in three different states. [Marks: 5]  
    **Answer:** The experiments show that solids, liquids, and gases each have distinct properties—in terms of shape, volume, and compressibility—because of the different ways their molecules are arranged and interact; closely packed and fixed in solids, loosely packed and mobile in liquids, and widely spaced in gases, thus proving the existence of three states of matter.

59. **Question:** Why is it important to understand the different states of matter? [Marks: 2]  
    **Answer:** It is important to understand the different states of matter because this knowledge helps us explain and predict how various materials will behave in everyday situations and in different conditions.
