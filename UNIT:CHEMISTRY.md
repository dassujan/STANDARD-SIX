# CHEMISTRY: INTRODUCTION TO CHEMISTRY [UNIT]

### Section 1: The Journey of Science – From Curiosity to Discovery

**What It Covers:**  
- **What Is Science?**  
  Science is described as the organized effort by human beings to study and understand nature. It is based on careful observations and experiments.

- **Early Discoveries:**  
  Long ago, humans used simple tools like stones. They noticed that rubbing two stones together could produce heat, which eventually led to making fire. This fire was used to cook food and keep animals away. Such observations laid the foundation for scientific knowledge.

- **Learning from Nature:**  
  Observing natural events (like seeing a seed grow into a tree) encouraged early humans to learn and later pass on this knowledge, which is how science developed over time.

This Section explains that science begins with everyday observations and grows through experiments and discoveries.

### Section 2: What Is Chemistry?

**What It Covers:**  
- **Definition of Chemistry:**  
  Chemistry is the branch of science that studies the composition of different substances and how they change. It answers questions like:
  - What are things made of?
  - How do they change?
  - Can humans make these substances?

- **Relation to Other Branches:**  
  Science is divided into three main branches: Physics, Chemistry, Biology
  
  Chemistry is special because it deals with substances and the various transformations they can undergo.

This part helps you understand that chemistry is all about the building blocks of matter and the changes they experience.

### Section 3: The Story of Alchemy and the Birth of Modern Chemistry

**What It Covers:**  
- **Alchemy:**  
  Alchemy comes from the Greek word *Khemeia*, which means the “art of transmuting metals.” Early alchemists mixed experiments with spiritual beliefs. They even tried to find the philosopher’s stone—a magical substance believed to turn metals into gold and offer health and immortality.

- **Contribution of Alchemy:**  
  Even though they did not succeed in finding the philosopher’s stone, alchemists learned many techniques. They were the first to isolate elements like zinc and phosphorus. Their work laid the groundwork for what we now call modern chemistry.

- **Transition to Modern Chemistry:**  
  By the 18th century, the mystical practices of alchemy were replaced with systematic scientific experiments. Modern chemistry grew from these early efforts with a focus on safety, accuracy, and controlled methods.

This Section shows the evolution from mystical alchemy to the systematic approach of modern chemistry.

### Section 4: Great Scientists Who Changed Chemistry

**What It Covers:**  
- **Pioneers of Chemistry:**  
  Several key scientists are honored in this Section:

  - **Robert William Boyle:**  
    Known as the Father of Modern Chemistry, he started using controlled experiments.

  - **Antoine Lavoisier:**  
    He named elements such as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and discovered the role of oxygen in breathing and burning.

  - **John Dalton:**  
    Proposed that matter is made of small particles called atoms.

  - **Dmitri Mendeleev:**  
    Created the Periodic Table by organizing elements according to their properties.

  - **Other Notable Scientists:**  
    Acharya P.C. Ray, Alfred Nobel, Marie Curie, and several others made significant discoveries that continue to influence chemistry.
