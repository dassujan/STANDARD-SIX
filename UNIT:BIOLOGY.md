# Biology: Plant Life (Unit)

## Section 1: Introduction to Plant Life

**1.1 What Makes Up a Plant**

- **Vegetative Parts:**  
  - Plants grow from the soil. The parts that help in nutrition and growth are called the vegetative parts.  
  - The vegetative parts are made up of the root system and partly of the shoot system.  
    - **Root System:**  
      - The roots grow in the soil.
      - Their jobs are to fix (anchor) the plant firmly to the soil and to absorb water and minerals.
    - **Shoot System:**  
      - The shoot system grows above the soil and includes the main stem, branches, and leaves.
      - Its jobs are to support the plant, make food by a process called photosynthesis, and transport the food to storage organs and other parts of the plant.

- **Reproductive Parts:**  
  - The reproductive part of the plant is the flower.  
  - The flower has special parts (male and female organs) that help in producing fruits (which are ripened seeds).  
  - The fruit develops from the flower and contains the seeds which can grow into a new plant.

**1.2 Important Terminology**

- **Terminal Bud:**  
  - It is an undeveloped shoot, made up of overlapping leaves. Every stem and branch ends with a terminal bud.
- **Axillary Bud:**  
  - It is found at the angle (axil) where the leaf stalk (petiole) meets the stem.
- **Stem, Node, Internode:**  
  - **Stem:** The above-ground part that holds up the leaves, branches, flowers, and fruits.
  - **Node:** A point on the stem from which leaves (and buds) arise.
  - **Internode:** The region between two successive nodes.
- **Other Terms:**  
  - **Leaf:** A flat, green part that helps in making food by photosynthesis and in losing excess water by transpiration.  
  - **Petiole:** The stalk that connects the leaf blade to the leaf base.
  - **Root:** The underground part that fixes the plant to the soil and absorbs water and minerals.
  - **Stipule:** A small outgrowth at the base of the leaf that may protect the budding leaves.
  - **Pulvinus:** A swollen leaf base.

## Section 2: The External Structure of a Leaf

**2.1 Main Parts of a Typical Leaf**

- **Leaf Base:**  
  - This is the part where the leaf attaches to the stem.
  - In many plants, the leaf base is flattened into a sheath, as seen in the banana plant.  
- **Petiole (Leaf Stalk):**  
  - It is the cylindrical part that holds the leaf blade and connects it to the stem.
  - When a leaf does not have a petiole, it is called a “sessile leaf.” (Plants with sessile leaves often belong to the monocotyledons.)
- **Lamina or Leaf Blade:**  
  - This is the flat, expanded part of the leaf.
  - It contains a thick, linear midrib (the main vein) that extends from the petiole to the tip of the leaf.
  - Smaller veins branch out from the midrib to form veinlets.

**2.2 Venation – The Pattern of Veins**

- **Reticulate Venation:**  
  - The veins and veinlets spread out in a network.
  - This type is most common in dicotyledons (for example, peepal and China-rose).
- **Parallel Venation:**  
  - Veins run parallel to the midrib.
  - This type is seen in monocotyledons, such as grasses and canna.
- **Functions of Veins:**
  - They give support and rigidity to the leaf.
  - They distribute water and minerals throughout the leaf blade.
  - They channel the food produced in the leaf into the stem.

## Section 3: Types of Leaves and Their Arrangements

**3.1 Simple and Compound Leaves**

- **Simple Leaf:**  
  - The entire leaf blade (lamina) is undivided.
  - It usually has an axillary bud in its axil.
  - The midrib runs through the center, and stipules are present at the base.
  - **Examples:** Mango and China-rose.
- **Compound Leaf:**  
  - The leaf blade is divided into several segments called leaflets.
  - The leaflets are attached to a common midrib called the rachis.
  - In compound leaves, the axillary bud is found on the leaf stalk (rachis), not on individual leaflets.
  - **Examples:** Neem (pinnately compound) and silk cotton (palmately compound).

**3.2 Arrangement of Leaves (Phyllotaxy)**

- **Alternate Arrangement:**  
  - One leaf arises at each node.
- **Opposite Arrangement:**  
  - Two leaves appear on either side of the same node.
- **Whorled Arrangement:**  
  - Three or more leaves arise from a single node arranged in a circle.

## Section 4: Functions of the Leaf

**4.1 Main Functions**

- **Photosynthesis:**  
  - Leaves allow a process called photosynthesis to take place.
  - They use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to prepare food (carbohydrates) with the help of a green pigment called chlorophyll.
  - Oxygen is given out as a by-product.
  - This process is very important because it releases oxygen and makes food the base of the food chain.
- **Transpiration:**  
  - This is the process in which leaves lose excess water as water vapor.
  - Transpiration helps to cool the plant and is important in the water cycle.
- **Exchange of Respiratory Gases:**  
  - During respiration, leaves take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.
  - The exchange happens through tiny openings called stomata.
  - Guard cells surround the stomata and control the opening and closing.

## Section 5: Leaf Modifications

Leaves can change their shape or function to help the plant in special ways. Here are some types of modifications:

- **Tendrils:**  
  - Some leaves or parts of leaves are modified into thin, wiry structures called tendrils.
  - Tendrils help weak-stemmed plants to climb up a support.
- **Spines:**  
  - In hot, dry regions, leaves may be reduced to spines to reduce water loss and protect the plant from animals.
  - (Remember: A sharp pointed modified stem is called a thorn, but a sharp pointed modified leaf or stipule is called a spine.)
- **Bulbs for Food Storage:**  
  - In some plants, leaves become fleshy and store food.
  - For example, in the bulb of an onion, the inner leaves are thick and filled with stored food, while the outer leaves are dry and protect the inner ones.
- **Carnivorous Leaves:**  
  - Some plants grow in soil that does not provide much nitrogen. Their leaves are modified to trap and digest insects.
  - Examples include the pitcher plant and Venus flytrap.
- **Vegetative Propagation:**  
  - In some plants (like Bryophyllum), buds can form along the margins of the leaves.
  - These buds can grow into new plants with roots, shoots, and leaves.

## Section 6: Experiments Demonstrating Leaf Functions

**Experiment 1: Demonstrating the Role of Chlorophyll and Starch**

- A green leaf is removed from the plant and boiled in methylated spirit (alcohol) over a water bath.
- **What happens?**
  - The green pigment chlorophyll dissolves in the spirit, turning the alcohol green.
  - The leaf itself turns white because the chlorophyll is removed.
  - When a few drops of iodine are added to the white leaf, it turns blue-black, showing that starch is present.
- **Understanding It:**  
  - Chlorophyll gives the leaf its green color and is essential for photosynthesis.
  - The presence of starch shows that the leaf had been making food.

**Experiment 2: Demonstrating Oxygen Production**

- A small water plant like hydrilla is set under a funnel in a beaker filled with water. A test-tube is placed inverted over the stem.
- **What happens?**
  - When the plant is exposed to sunlight, oxygen bubbles are released from the cut stem and collect in the test-tube.
  - When a glowing splinter is introduced into the collected gas, it bursts into flames, indicating that the gas is oxygen.
- **Understanding It:**  
  - This experiment shows that during photosynthesis, oxygen is given out by the leaves.

## Section 7: Summary and Key Facts

**Key Points to Remember:**

1. **Plant System:**  
   - A plant has a root system (below ground) and a shoot system (above ground with stem, leaves, branches, flowers, and fruits).
2. **Leaf Structure:**  
   - A typical leaf consists of the leaf base (attachment point), petiole (leaf stalk), and lamina (leaf blade).
   - The midrib runs through the lamina, and veins branch out to form a network.
3. **Types of Leaves:**  
   - **Simple Leaf:** The entire blade is undivided and has an axillary bud.
   - **Compound Leaf:** The blade is divided into leaflets; no axillary bud is present on the individual leaflets.
4. **Leaf Arrangement (Phyllotaxy):**  
   - Leaves may be arranged alternately, oppositely, or in a whorled pattern on the stem.
5. **Functions of the Leaf:**  
   - **Photosynthesis:** Using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make food and produce oxygen.
   - **Transpiration:** Losing water as vapor to cool the plant.
   - **Gas Exchange:** Taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through stomata.
6. **Leaf Modifications:**  
   - Leaves can be modified into tendrils for climbing, spines for protection and reducing water loss, storage organs for food, or even traps to catch insects.  
   - Some modifications also allow plants to reproduce asexually through vegetative propagation.

23. **Question:** How are veins and veinlets arranged in a leaf? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Veins are arranged in a network within the leaf blade, where the midrib splits into smaller veins and then into even finer veinlets that distribute water, minerals, and food throughout the lamina.

24. **Question:** What does "venation" mean? (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** Venation is the arrangement of veins and veinlets on the leaf blade.

25. **Question:** Differentiate between reticulate and parallel venation with one example each. (Marks: 3)  
    **Answer:** In reticulate venation, the veins form an irregular network and is common in dicotyledons (e.g., peepal, China-rose), while in parallel venation, the veins run parallel to the midrib, which is typical of monocotyledons such as grasses.

26. **Question:** What are stipules, and why are they important? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Stipules are two lateral outgrowths seen at the base of the leaf that can be leafy or stiff like a thorn, and they are important because they help protect the bud and young leaf.

27. **Question:** What is a pulvinus in relation to a leaf? (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** A pulvinus is a swollen leaf base seen in some plants.

28. **Question:** Summarize the main functions of the veins in the leaf. (Marks: 3)  
    **Answer:** Veins serve as the skeletal framework of the leaf by providing support and rigidity, distribute water and minerals throughout the lamina, and channel the food produced by photosynthesis into the stem for distribution.

29. **Question:** Why are leaves generally green in colour? (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** Leaves are green because they contain the pigment chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis.

30. **Question:** What is the role of the leaf stalk (petiole) regarding the plant group classification? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Leaves with a petiole are referred to as petiolate and are commonly found in dicotyledons; plants without a petiole have sessile leaves and often belong to monocotyledons.

### **Section 3: Types of Leaves and Their Arrangements**

31. **Question:** What is a simple leaf and how does it differ from a compound leaf? (Marks: 3)

34. **Question:** What is the rachis in a compound leaf? (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** The rachis is the main vein of a compound leaf to which all the leaflets are attached.

35. **Question:** Explain the term "phyllotaxy." (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Phyllotaxy is the arrangement of leaves on the stem so that they get maximum sunlight and perform their functions efficiently.

36. **Question:** Name the three main types of phyllotaxy and briefly describe each. (Marks: 3)  
    **Answer:** The three main types of phyllotaxy are alternate (one leaf per node), opposite (two leaves on either side of the node), and whorled (three or more leaves arranged in a circle at one node).

37. **Question:** What type of leaf has an axillary bud present in its axil? (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** A simple leaf has an axillary bud present in its axil.

38. **Question:** How can you recognize a compound leaf based on its structure? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** You can recognize a compound leaf because its lamina is divided into several leaflets, and none of these individual leaflets bear an axillary bud.

39. **Question:** Why do you think leaves may be arranged alternately on the stem? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Leaves are arranged alternately on the stem to ensure that each leaf gets enough sunlight and air circulation, thereby optimizing photosynthesis.

40. **Question:** Provide one example each for alternate, opposite, and whorled leaf arrangements. (Marks: 3)  
    **Answer:** An example of an alternate arrangement is found in the sunflower, an opposite arrangement is seen in guava or Tulsi, and a whorled arrangement is found in plants like Nerium.

### **Section 4: Functions of the Leaf**

41. **Question:** What is the main function of a leaf in a plant? (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** The main function of a leaf is to perform photosynthesis, where sunlight is used to make food for the plant.

42. **Question:** Describe the process of photosynthesis as it occurs in the leaf. (Marks: 3)  
    **Answer:** In photosynthesis, the green pigment chlorophyll in the leaf uses sunlight along with water and carbon dioxide to make food in the form of carbohydrates, and oxygen is released as a by-product.

43. **Question:** Why is photosynthesis important for life on Earth? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Photosynthesis is important because it produces food for the plants and oxygen for all living beings, making green plants the base of the food chain.

44. **Question:** What is transpiration and why is it necessary? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Transpiration is the process by which leaves lose excess water as water vapor, and it is necessary because it helps cool the plant and plays a role in the water cycle.

45. **Question:** How do the leaves assist in gas exchange for the plant? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Leaves assist in gas exchange through small pores called stomata; they allow the intake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and the release of oxygen and water vapor.

46. **Question:** What role do guard cells play in the function of a leaf? (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** Guard cells surround the stomata and control their opening and closing, thus regulating gas exchange and water loss.

47. **Question:** List one process that takes place in the leaf besides photosynthesis and transpiration. (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** Besides photosynthesis and transpiration, leaves also take part in the exchange of respiratory gases during the process of respiration.

48. **Question:** Why are green plants called “primary food producers”? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Green plants are called “primary food producers” because they make their own food through photosynthesis and are the starting point of the food chain.

49. **Question:** In simple terms, how does the thin and flat shape of a leaf benefit the plant? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** The thin and flat shape of a leaf provides a large surface area for sunlight to be absorbed and for gases to exchange, making photosynthesis more efficient.

50. **Question:** Explain in one sentence how oxygen is produced during photosynthesis. (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis as a by-product when chlorophyll in the leaf converts sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into food.

### **Section 5: Leaf Modifications**

51. **Question:** What are tendrils and what is their function in a plant? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Tendrils are modified leaves or leaflets that are thin and wiry, and they help the plant to climb up supports.

52. **Question:** How are spines different from thorns? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Spines are modified leaves or stipules that are sharp and pointed to reduce water loss and protect the plant, while thorns are modified stems that serve as a defense mechanism.

53. **Question:** Give an example of a plant where the leaves are modified into spines. (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** The cactus is an example of a plant where the leaves are modified into spines.

54. **Question:** What modification do some plants have in order to store food, and give one example. (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Some plants modify their leaves into fleshy structures, such as bulbs, for food storage; an example is the onion.

55. **Question:** Describe how the leaf of the Venus flytrap is modified. (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** In the Venus flytrap, part of the leaf is modified to form a trap with spiny edges and a slippery surface so that when an insect lands inside, it is caught and digested.

56. **Question:** What does “vegetative propagation” mean with respect to leaves? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Vegetative propagation means that a new plant is produced from a bud on a vegetative part of the plant, such as a leaf; for example, in Bryophyllum, buds form along the leaf margin and grow into new plants.

57. **Question:** Why might a plant in a dry environment modify its leaves into spines? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** A plant in a dry environment may modify its leaves into spines to reduce the surface area through which water is lost by transpiration and to protect itself from being eaten.

58. **Question:** Explain in one sentence how modified leaves help in the survival of plants. (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** Modified leaves help in the survival of plants by adapting to different conditions, such as climbing, storing food, reducing water loss, or trapping insects for extra nutrients.

59. **Question:** Identify one benefit of having tendrils for a climbing plant. (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** Tendrils allow a climbing plant to secure itself to a support, enabling it to grow upward towards the sunlight.

60. **Question:** How do modifications in leaves (like those in carnivorous plants) assist in nutrient supply? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** In carnivorous plants, the leaves are modified to trap and digest insects, providing the plant with proteins and nutrients when the soil is poor.

### **Section 6: Experiments Demonstrating Leaf Functions**

61. **Question:** What was the purpose of boiling a green leaf in methylated spirit in Experiment 1? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Boiling a green leaf in methylated spirit was done to remove chlorophyll, which turns the leaf white and shows that the chlorophyll has dissolved in the spirit, turning it green.

62. **Question:** What did the addition of iodine to the decolourised leaf demonstrate? (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** The addition of iodine to the decolourised leaf demonstrated the presence of starch, as the leaf turned blue-black.

63. **Question:** In Experiment 2, what was collected in the inverted test-tube and why? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Oxygen bubbles were collected in the inverted test-tube because the water plant, when exposed to sunlight, produces oxygen during photosynthesis.

64. **Question:** How did the glowing splinter test confirm the gas collected was oxygen? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** When the glowing splinter was introduced into the collected gas, it burst into flames, confirming that the gas was oxygen.

65. **Question:** Why is it important to perform experiments like these in class? (Marks: 2)  
    **Answer:** Experiments like these are important because they help us see and understand the processes of photosynthesis and oxygen production by plants in a practical, visual way.

66. **Question:** What does the color change in the methylated spirit indicate when a leaf is boiled? (Marks: 1)  
    **Answer:** The color change in the methylated spirit, from colorless to green, indicates that the chlorophyll from the leaf has dissolved into the spirit.

67. **Question:** Briefly explain what the experiments show about the role of the leaf. (Marks: 3)  
    **Answer:** The experiments show that the leaf is the site for photosynthesis—where chlorophyll converts sunlight into food—and that it produces oxygen as a by-product, while also storing starch that results from the process.

68. **Question:** Explain why leaves are crucial in maintaining the food chain and the water cycle. (Marks: 3)  
    **Answer:** Leaves are crucial because they perform photosynthesis to produce food and oxygen, forming the base of the food chain, and through transpiration, they release water vapor that helps in maintaining the water cycle.

# Biology: Flower and Fruit (Unit)

## 1. Introduction

A flowering plant is made of different parts that work together for the plant’s growth and reproduction. The main parts are:  
- **Root:** Absorbs water and minerals from the soil.  
- **Stem and Leaves:** These are called the vegetative parts of the plant. They help in food production and growth.  
- **Flower:** This is the reproductive part that creates new plants. In the flower, the **stamens (male parts)** and the **pistil (female parts)** work together.  

When the male gamete (in pollen) fuses with the female gamete (in the ovule) during fertilisation, a seed is formed. Under the right conditions of air, water, and temperature, seeds grow into new plants. Flowers are also very attractive as they have bright colors and pleasant smells, which help them attract insects and birds for pollination.

## 2. The Flower: Structure and Parts

A typical flower is a modified shoot that develops from a floral bud and contains several arranged parts called whorls. These whorls are grouped into two types: those directly involved in reproduction and those that help in protection and attraction.

### A. Essential Whorls (Reproductive Parts)

1. **Androecium (Stamens):**  
   - **Stamen:** The male part of the flower.  
     - **Filament:** A slender stalk that holds the anther.  
     - **Anther:** The rounded head where pollen is produced.  
   - **Function:** The anthers produce pollen grains containing the male gametes.

2. **Gynoecium (Pistil or Carpels):**  
   - **Pistil/Carpel:** The female part made up of three parts:  
     - **Stigma:** A sticky, knob-like tip; it is the landing place for pollen.  
     - **Style:** A tube-like structure that connects the stigma with the ovary.  
     - **Ovary:** The enlarged part at the base that contains ovules.  
   - **Function:** After fertilisation, the ovary grows into a fruit and the ovules become seeds.

### B. Non-Essential Whorls (Protection and Attraction)

1. **Calyx (Sepals):**  
   - **Appearance:** They are green and leaf-like.  
   - **Function:** They protect the flower while it is in the bud stage. They might also help in photosynthesis.

2. **Corolla (Petals):**  
   - **Appearance:** Usually brightly colored (for example, pink) and sometimes fragrant.  
   - **Function:** The colorful and pleasant-smelling petals attract insects and birds for pollination.

### Other Parts of the Flower

- **Pedicel:** The stalk that holds up the flower.  
- **Thalamus:** The upper, swollen part of the pedicel from which the floral whorls emerge.  
- **Bracts and Bracteoles:** Small, sometimes modified leaf-like structures found at the base of the flower. In some flowers (like hibiscus), an extra whorl called the **epicalyx** (a group of bracteoles) is present.

## 3. Pollination and Fertilisation

### A. Pollination

Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther (male part) to the stigma (female part). This process can happen in two ways:

1. **Self-Pollination:**  
   - Pollen from the anther of a flower is transferred to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant.  
   - **Advantage:** There is little wastage of pollen.  
   - **Disadvantage:** Offspring have similar genetic makeup (no variation).

2. **Cross-Pollination:**  
   - Pollen is transferred from the anther of a flower on one plant to the stigma of a flower on a different plant of the same species.  
   - **Advantage:** It creates genetic variation among the offspring.  

**Pollinating Agents:**  
- **Insects:** Attracted by bright colors and sweet scents.  
- **Wind:** Carries light and smooth pollen grains from one flower to another.  
- **Water:** Helps aquatic plants by floating pollen.  
- **Birds:** Attracted to certain colors like red and orange and to the nectar provided in the flowers.

### B. Fertilisation

Fertilisation is the process in which the male gamete (from the pollen) fuses with the female gamete (inside the ovule) to form a zygote. After fertilisation:  
- The zygote develops into an embryo within the seed.  
- The ovary transforms into a fruit, and the ovules become seeds.

## 4. Fruit Formation and Structure

After fertilisation, the flower’s ovary develops into a fruit. A fruit is a ripened ovary, and it plays important roles:

### A. Structure of a Fruit

A typical fruit is made up of two main parts:

1. **Pericarp (Fruit Wall):**  
   - **Epicarp:** The outer skin or layer.  
   - **Mesocarp:** The middle fleshy part.  
   - **Endocarp:** The inner layer that directly surrounds the seed.
   
2. **Seeds:** The part that develops from the ovules and can grow into a new plant under favorable conditions.

### B. Functions of the Fruit

- **Protection:** The fruit encloses the seeds and protects them from injury and unfavorable weather.  
- **Food:** Fruits are important sources of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. They provide food for both humans and animals.  
- **Seed Dispersal:** Fruits help in spreading the seeds. Animals may eat the fruits and later disperse the seeds. Some fruits are light or have special structures that let wind or water carry the seeds away.

## 5. Types of Fruits

Fruits are classified into three main types:

1. **Berries:**  
   - **Description:** Fleshy fruits without a hard stone or pit.  
   - **Examples:** Tomato, Kiwi, Watermelon.

2. **Drupes:**  
   - **Description:** Fleshy fruit with thin skin and a central hard stone (pit) that contains the seed.  
   - **Examples:** Mango, Plum, Avocado.

3. **Pome (False Fruit):**  
   - **Description:** Develops partly from the thalamus (not entirely from the ovary) so that the edible part surrounds the seeds.  
   - **Examples:** Apple, Pear.

## 6. Summary of Important Points

- **Flowering Plant Structure:**  
  The vegetative parts (roots, stem, and leaves) support the plant's growth, while the flower is responsible for reproduction.

- **Flower Structure:**  
  A typical flower has four whorls: calyx (sepals), corolla (petals), androecium (stamens), and gynoecium (pistils).  
  - **Pedicel:** Supports the flower.  
  - **Thalamus:** The swollen part of the pedicel from which the flower parts develop.

- **Pollination:**  
  Pollen is transferred from the anther to the stigma. This can occur by self-pollination or cross-pollination with the help of agents like insects, wind, water, or birds.

- **Fertilisation:**  
  The fusion of the male and female gametes to form a zygote, which later grows into an embryo within the seed. The ovary becomes a fruit, and the ovules become seeds.

- **Fruit Structure and Function:**  
  A fruit protects the seeds, supplies food, and helps in dispersing the seeds far from the parent plant. It has a pericarp made of three layers: epicarp, mesocarp, and endocarp.

- **Types of Fruits:**  
  - **Berries:** Fleshy fruits without a stone.  
  - **Drupes:** Fleshy fruits with a stone.  
  - **Pomes:** Also known as false fruits; they form partly from the thalamus.

## 7. Easy Explanation in Short

- **Flower:** A flower is a specially modified shoot where reproduction happens. It has parts that protect it and parts that help in making seeds.  
- **Pollination:** Involves moving pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part. It can occur within the same flower or between different plants, using wind, water, insects, or birds.  
- **Fertilisation:** When pollen reaches the ovule, the male and female cells combine to form a zygote that eventually grows into a seed.  
- **Fruit:** The ovary of the flower becomes a fruit after fertilisation, and the ovules inside develop into seeds. Fruits protect seeds and help spread them, so new plants can grow.
